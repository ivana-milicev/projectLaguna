2. **Implement API testing** for cart and checkout operations
3. **Add performance testing** to measure page load times
4. **Expand test coverage** to include:
   - Multiple product purchases
   - Different payment methods
   - Guest checkout flow
   - User registration flow

### Code Quality:
1. **Both test suites (Playwright & Selenium)** are well-structured with Page Object Model
2. **Configuration management** properly handles CI and local environments
3. **Error handling** is robust with screenshots on failure
4. **Retry mechanisms** effectively handle timing issues
